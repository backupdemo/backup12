                            Our main focus is on experience-based learning. The key element being that learners learn to
                            tackle a situation by reflecting, evaluating and reconstructing it in order to draw meaning
                            from it in the light of prior experience.
                            <br>
                            The key points that our product is fixed upon are:
                            <ul>
								<li>Experience is the foundation of, and the stimulus for, our product</li>
								<li>Learners will unknowingly construct their own experience</li>
								<li>Experience based learning provided is holistic.</li>
								<li> Our product is socially and culturally constructed</li>
								<li>Our product is influenced by the socio-economic context and also depends on the
                            consequences of your actions.</li>
